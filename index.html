				Indoor dining reopens in NYC without much fanfare and a lot of new rules

				<figcaption>An empty dining room awaits the first indoor dining guests at Archies Tap and Bar. Julian Gannon, 21, has been a server here for a few years. He lives next door with his mother, who happens to be the Director of
					Health and Human Services for Ruben Diaz, Jr., Bronx Borough President. She's not worried. So neither is he. </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p class="intro">After a long period of absence, indoor dining reopened in New York City this past Wednesday. On Bronx’s City Island, a community known for both seafood and already booming outdoor dining scene, we spent the day with
				restaurant owners who are navigating the regulations for the first time. </p>
			<p>
				The city released an eight-page manual of the new list, including both legal and “recommended” best practices.
			</p>
			<p>
				Restaurants can only open at 25%. “That is not even enough to pay a Verizon bill,” says Alexander Petrovsky, chef and owner of Archies Tap and Bar. Petrovsky is a community gathering place for locals, hosting Representative Ocascio-Cortez’s
				victory party in 2019. While the dining room opened on Wednesday, it remained empty as diners used the backyard.

				<figcaption> Calliope Rigos, 57, fell into cooking at an early age after deciding between culinary school and the Coast Guard. "I'm not sure I made the right choice," she says, envious of her retired friends, a luxury
					she may never be able to afford.

			<p class="intro">
				“It’s hard to make people feel comfortable,” says Calliope Rigos, owner of Black Whale as she tries to figure what the best location will be for the thermometer to monitor the temperature of her customers upon entering. Rigos is lucky to
				have a backyard that she is very proud of and hopes her customers will be in no rush to head indoors.</p>
			<p>
				Should you decide to venture indoors, we’ve compiled the essential rules that restaurants must follow. We also recommend a hearty tip.
